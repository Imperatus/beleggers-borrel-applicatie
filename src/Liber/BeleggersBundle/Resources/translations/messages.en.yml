    global: On this page you can set your currency. In future releases, the application will display the correct symbol app-wide.<br /><br />  Furthermore, if you work with <i>Coins</i> or <i>Barslips</i>, you can define their price and give them a name here.<br /> For instance, if you sell coins of a worth of 1 euro, use the slider to set the unit price to 1.00.<br /><br />  At the Cashier, prices get shown in your currency as well as the unit you define.
